[The American Statistician paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2022.2089232) by Mine and Monika includes the following breakdown of topics by area for a Bayesian course. What do you think of them?\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](TAStopics.png){fig-align='center' width=500}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Discussion Questions\n\n::: nonincremental\n2. [The American Statistician paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2022.2089232) by Mine and Monika includes\nthe following sample weekly schedules for a Bayesian course.

What has been your biggest challenge of teaching a Bayesian course/module? Have you figured out some solutions to it?\n\n4. What is your favorite topic when teaching a Bayesian course/module?\n\n5. If introducing a Bayesian module in an introductory/intermediate/advanced-level course in your field, what would be your plans, in terms of topic, data, computing, and modeling?\n\n6. What is the one challenge you would like to get help with from BATS bootcamp?\n\n# Large Group Sharing\n\n## Format and Length\n\n- About 25 minutes\n\n- We will record this portion for sharing later. Okay?\n\n- Each group reports back for 3 minutes\n\n- Open discussion for remaining time\n\n\n\n",
