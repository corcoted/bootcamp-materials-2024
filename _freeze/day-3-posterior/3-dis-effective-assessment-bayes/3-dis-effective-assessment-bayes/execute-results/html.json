[The American Statistician paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2022.2089232) by Mine and Monika includes the following recommendations for assessments of a Bayesian course. What do you think of them?\n\n    - Include a data analysis portion in a homework assignment and in an exam\n    - Include a course project component in course assessments\n    - Include formative assessments such as quizzes (low to no-grade contribution) to get students to do drill and practice exercises\n    - Be created with assessment tools\n    - In addition to lectures, use real data in every assessment when possible\n\n## Discussion Questions\n\n2. What assessment tool(s) you have found to be most effective. Why and what advice do you have for someone to give it a try?\n\n3. What assessment tool(s) you have found to be least effective. Why and do you have solutions to improve it/them?\n\n4. What is the one challenge you would like to get help with from BATS bootcamp?\n\n# Large Group Sharing\n\n## Format and Length\n\n- About 25 minutes\n\n- We will record this portion for sharing later. Okay?\n\n- Each group reports back for 3 minutes\n\n- Open discussion for remaining time\n\n\n\n",
